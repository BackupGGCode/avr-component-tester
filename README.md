# AVR Component Tester #

### DESCRIPTION ###
We really liked the original project; so we are bringing it back as ACT. Mainly for ourselves but anyone interested is welcome to build there own.

It is an AVR Atmega based electronic components tester based on the original _AVR Transistor Tester by Markus Frejek_. Its a completely open project, feel free to use the content on this Google code page in any way you like; as long as it follows the same or stricter guidelines then the original.

At the moment there is not much different then the original; other then we took away the multi-language (we will keep the strings editable for anyone interested in changing the language themselves) and only changed a few small items. Thats only because we are still awaiting our latest PCBs which includes onboard ISP header, broken out UART, and broken out un-used pins for future functionality.

Only reason I made this page was to store our updates to a public SVN.

Also see my [readme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BackupGGCode/avr-component-tester/master/README) file.
