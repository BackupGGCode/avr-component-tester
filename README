The firmware was specificly designed to on an Atmega328p but really; any 28pin atmega 8k and up will work; and as long as your utilizing winavr just make sure you include its IO header file; you should be able to upload the source no problem. Ensure to double check the pinout and make changes as needed.

At some point I will most likly include differnt pre-compiled files for multiple atmega's for the public, depending on if there is any demand at all. Most likly there will be none, as its really just a personal project.

I also have some left-over PCBs; so if your interested just contact BrentBXR and I might be able to mail you one. As long as you promise to build it up, and enjoy it. I wont send somone a PCB just so they can have a PCB laying around...
